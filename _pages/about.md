Hi there! I'm Gabo, a PhD student in Mathematics at [Universidad de Buenos Aires](https://www.uba.ar/) in Buenos Aires, Argentina, working at the intersection between Category Theory, Logic and Computer Science.

I am part of the [Logic, Language and Computability Research Group (GLyC)](https://glyc.dc.uba.ar/). My advisor is [Santiago Figueira](https://glyc.dc.uba.ar/santiago/). My research is funded by [CONICET](https://www.conicet.gov.ar/), Argentina's National Research Council.

Below you will find a description of the main motivations behind my research, current and otherwise. I am always happy to discuss these topics, so please get in touch if you are so inclined.

You can find my list of publications [here](publications).
