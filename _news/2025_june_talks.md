In the past few weeks I have given two talks on the topic of what I am calling _arboreal coreflections_, one at the [Applied Category Theory (ACT) 2025](https://gataslab.org/act2025/act2025) conference in Gainesville, Florida, USA; and another at the [Foundational Methods in Computer Science (FMCS) 2025](https://sites.google.com/view/fmcs-ottawa/home?authuser=0) Workshop in Ottawa, Canada.
